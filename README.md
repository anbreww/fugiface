# Fugiface v3

Front-end client for the Fugidaire, to display the list of beers on tap, and
later manage what beers are available and do a little inventory management.

## Getting started

This project was built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app),
refer to the project's documentation for more details. I'll add more to this
readme after the project is working.

To get started, open a terminal in the root folder, and run the following
commands to start a development server.

```
npm install
npm start
```
